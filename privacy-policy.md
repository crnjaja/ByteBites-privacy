### Introduction  
Our privacy policy will help you understand what information we collect at ExpoNomade, how ExpoNomade uses it, and what choices you have.
Exponomade built the ExpoNomade app as a free app. This SERVICE is provided by ExpoNomade at no cost and is intended for use as is.
If you choose to use our Service, then you agree to the collection and use of information in  relation with this policy. The Personal Information that we collect are used for providing and improving the Service. We will not use or share your information with anyone except as described in this Privacy Policy.  
The terms used in this Privacy Policy have the same meanings as in our Terms and Conditions, which is accessible in our website, unless otherwise  defined in this Privacy Policy.

### Data Protection
The cantonal law on public information, data protection, and archiving (LIPDA; RS 170.2) aims to ensure that everyone's rights and fundamental freedoms are respected when personal data is processed by the authorities. We strictly adhere to these provisions. In this regard, personal data is treated with complete confidentiality and is neither sold nor transmitted to unauthorized third parties.

### Data Security
When accessing the website or sending information via email, we cannot rule out the possibility that data may be transmitted incompletely or accessed by third parties. Therefore, we kindly ask you not to send confidential information via email. We generally respond to inquiries received by email in the same manner. If you prefer not to receive a reply by email, please indicate this in your message.

### Cookies
Like many other websites, we use "cookies." Cookies are small text files that are transferred from a website's server to your hard drive. The information contained in cookies makes browsing easier and ensures the proper display of web pages. For example, cookies are used to support the selection of the website's language.

### Right of Access and Correction
In accordance with Articles 31 and following of the LIPDA, any person may request in writing from the data controller access to the data collected about them on the BytesBite app, and, if necessary, request its update, correction, or deletion. When subscribing to content or filling out a contact form, we process the data necessary to provide the requested service. Depending on the service in question, the following data may be processed: email address, last name, first name, title, full address, phone number, contactform message, restaurant review booking and orders history. This data is processed only if you provide it voluntarily and is used exclusively for the purpose of delivering the service you requested.

### Third-party cookies and links to third-party websites
X, YouTube, Instagram, Flickr, and other tools managed by third parties may install cookies for content sharing on social media platforms or for compiling usage statistics. The presence, number, and status of these cookies may depend on how you have used those platforms before or during your visit. Additionally, the ByteBites app may include links to third-party websites. By clicking on these links, you leave the app, and these third-party sites may process personal data about you. You are encouraged to check the cookie management policies applied by the respective websites.

### Data Protection Declaration for Web Analytics
Here, anonymized visit data is collected for the purpose of optimizing the online offerings using Google Analytics, a web analytics tool (https://analytics.google.com/) and stored in their infrastructure. The usage data collected by Google Analytics is anonymous. It is not used to personally identify visitors to this website, nor is it merged with other personal data, and it is not transmitted to third parties. You have the option to use the "Decline Statistical Cookies" setting to prevent the analysis of your actions here. The "Decline Statistical Cookies" option disables the transmission of anonymized data to the Google Analytics server. This means that no statistical data from a user's visit is sent to the server, and this visit is not recorded in Google Analytics. This will protect your privacy but will also prevent the site manager from learning from your actions and improving the site's usability for you and other users.

### The different types of cookies used
To offer you the best possible experience, we may use cookies on ByteBites, which are categorized into two types. Functional cookies: These cookies are essential because they enable basic functions of the website. For example, they help us remember your language preferences and ensure that you stay logged in when navigating from one page to another. Statistical cookies (tracking cookies): These cookies help us analyze visitor behavior on our website to improve its offerings and functionality. They allow us to collect anonymous information, such as the most visited pages or the time visitors spend on a given page. Enabling or disabling these statistical cookies is up to you. By enabling them, you help us further optimize our site and personalize your experience. You can find more information in the section "Data Protection Declaration for Web Analytics".

You can use the Contact Form inside the profile tab to ask for your data and/or profile to be deleted.
